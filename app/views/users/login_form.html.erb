  <h4>A note about logging in</h4>
  <p>There is no password field. In fact, there is no indication whatsoever
  that you are who you say you are. There's nothing special about users -
  username is just another piece of data that the user entered and we have to keep
  track of.
  </p>

  We'll learn more about security and authentication in the next couple weeks.
  For now, don't worry about it beyond what you can see here.
